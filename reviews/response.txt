replaced 'data' by 'datasets' in the title

included an example with up to 30% contaminated data to highlight tail behavior

exchanged the first example to show taxi in and out time by airline carrier

made bagplots and lvbagplots almost identical:
the difference between the bagplot and the letter-value bagplot in the last figure was due to a twofold approximation: the bagplot code in R from the aplpack package was computed based on a sample of size 300 instead of the whole dataset. The letter-value bagplot made use of convex hulls as an approximation of location depth. Both approximations are now gone, and the figure displays the same data. The remaining difference is -- in our opinion -- due to a smoothing of edges in the bagplot, whereas the points of the bag in the lvbagplot are  connected by straight lines, giving the bag a slightly 'edgier' look.
