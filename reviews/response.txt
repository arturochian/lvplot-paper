private note to the associate editor:
- I find reviewer one  condescending to the degree of being personally insulted.
While a personal acquaintace with J.W Tukey is something to be proud of, exposure to modern data problems might have been a better preparation for reviewing this paper.

Accusing our paper being 'turgid' is - particularly in light of this review - almost comical. 






replaced 'data' by 'datasets' in the title

quotes removed from "outliers" 

exchanged the first example to show taxi in and out time by airline carrier

included an example with up to 30% contaminated data to highlight tail behavior and compare lvboxplots to regular boxplots


made bagplots and lvbagplots almost identical:
the difference between the bagplot and the letter-value bagplot in the last figure was due to a twofold approximation: the bagplot code in R from the aplpack package was computed based on a sample of size 300 instead of the whole dataset. The letter-value bagplot made use of convex hulls as an approximation of location depth. Both approximations are now gone, and the figures display the same data. The remaining difference is -- in our opinion -- due to a smoothing of edges in the bagplot, whereas the points of the bag in the lvbagplot are  connected by straight lines, giving the bags a slightly 'edgier' look.
